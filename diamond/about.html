<p>                Divine Diamond Cutters is headed by an original master of diamond cutting with over 40 years of experience. Ygal Yaakov began cutting diamonds in Tel Aviv, Israel under his uncle. The family is part of a deep heritage of diamond cutting that has been passed down over 100 years. Beginning in the 1970’s, Ygal worked as a production manager in Tel Aviv overseeing the factory’s diamond cutting production. He mastered the diamond cutting trade during this time by specializing in cutting rough diamonds into polished goods. In the 1980’s, Ygal began to travel the world to spread his knowledge as a diamond cutting master. He has spent over a decade teaching others in factories located in Bangkok, Thailand, Johannesburg, South Africa, Antwerp, Belgium, Moscow, Russia and Mumbai, India. In some factories, the production would be as great as 5000 stones per day.
